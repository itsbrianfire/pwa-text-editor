## Installation
This web app uses a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. We also use node.js, [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), webpack in our JSON and Heroku for deployment.

To install and run, open the code in VS Code. 

Run the terminal and `npm i` to install packages. Type `npm start` to run the app and in open in `localhost:3000`.
